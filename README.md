I am **Julius Musyoki Samuel**, a dedicated learner in the **ALX Back-End Software Engineering Program**. I’m passionate about solving real-world problems using scalable backend technologies, building APIs, and driving sustainable development through software.

💡 I began my journey into software engineering because I believe in the power of **technology as a tool for transformation**. I am inspired by the potential of code to **automate solutions, connect people**, and **drive innovation** across the African continent.
